# OUWIBO NFT Protocol

OUWIBO is a next-generation NFT infrastructure and digital asset ecosystem built natively on the Base network. Designed for the Farcaster community, the protocol provides secure, gasless, and high-performance minting experiences for exclusive digital artifacts.

## Project Vision

The OUWIBO ecosystem aims to bridge the gap between social identity and on-chain utility. By leveraging the Base network's scalability and Farcaster's social layer, we provide a foundation for decentralized governance, exclusive community access, and long-term asset value.

## Core Asset Collections

### 1. Ouwibo Genesis (ID #0)
*   **Tier:** Legendary
*   **Utility:** The ultimate access pass to the Ouwibo ecosystem. Holders receive primary governance rights, $SHELL token allocations, and priority access to infrastructure nodes.

### 2. Ouwibo Voyager (ID #1)
*   **Tier:** Epic
*   **Utility:** Designed for early explorers of the Base ecosystem. Unlocks advanced trading features, marketplace fee discounts, and Phase 2 airdrop priority.

### 3. Ouwibo Citizen (ID #2)
